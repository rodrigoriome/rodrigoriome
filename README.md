### Hello there üëã

I am Rodrigo;

I'm a young, yet experienced developer, graduated in 2020 in Systems Analysis and that works with code since 2014 (self-taught devs, wya?);

I have good front-end skills in my toolkit, along with a broad view of the programming world;

I am interested in learning new techniques that can improve the products I ship;

I've been a junior Web Designer in the past, so among my Web Development skills, I also have an acute view for design as well;

I live at the beach in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, where I have the pleasure to see sunsets whenever the weather allows me üòÅ;

I have written stuff in PHP, JavaScript, Typescript, Python and C before, but JavaScript is my main language with PHP being the next in that list;

Coding is actually fun when you got a challenging project and time to write good code;

Fun fact: I have written this README inspired by [@eddiejaoude](https://github.com/eddiejaoude)

#### Work

I have developed several business projects from ground up, but they're private and I don't have too much personal stuff.

Here are some dumb projects that were actually fun to develop.

- [Type App (React)](https://rodrigoriome.github.io/type-app-react)
- [Type App (Vue)](https://rodrigoriome.github.io//type-app-vue)
- [Fincalc](https://rodrigoriome.github.io/fincalc)

I hope to work with OSS as soon as I get enough experience with it.
