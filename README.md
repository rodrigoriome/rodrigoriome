### Hello there üëã

My name is Rodrigo.

I'm a young, yet experienced developer, graduated in 2020 in Systems Analysis and that works with code since 2014 (self-taught devs, wya?).

I have good front-end skills in my toolkit, along with a broad view of the programming world.

I am interested in learning new techniques that can improve the products I ship.

I've been a junior Web Designer in the past, so among my Web Development skills, I also have an acute view for design as well.

I live at the beach in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, where I have the pleasure to see sunsets whenever the clouds allow me üòÅ.

I'm used to speak English in my daily work, and in games as well whenever I have time.

Health is important to me, so if you need me to change the color of a button, while I'm at the gym... It not gonna happen.

I have written stuff in PHP, JavaScript, Typescript, Python and C before, but JavaScript is my main language with PHP being the next in that list.

Coding is actually fun when you got a challenging project and time to write good code.

Maybe one day I'll add my social media here so we can have a talk about anything... except code, lol.

Fun fact: I have written this README inspired by @eddiejaoude

#### Work

I have already developed dozens of business projects from ground up, but they're private and I don't have too much personal stuff.

Here are some dumb projects that were actually fun to develop.

- [Type App (React)](https://rodrigoriome.github.io/type-app-react)
- [Type App (Vue)]((https://rodrigoriome.github.io//type-app-vue)
- [Fincalc]((https://rodrigoriome.github.io/fincalc)

I hope to work with OSS as soon as I get enough experience (I don't want to be the `#a5s6d1 (chore) fix typo in comment` kind of collaborator, lol).

If you felt inconfortable reading in paragraphs, I'm sorry.
